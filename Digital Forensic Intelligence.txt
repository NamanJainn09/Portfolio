## 1. CASE INITIATION

You are entering an active digital investigation.  
All information presented is evidence-backed, traceable, and reproducible.

Case Officer: Naman  
Domains: Forensic Science · AI · Cybersecurity · Cognitive Signals  
Operational Model: Evidence → Analysis → Reconstruction → Findings

---

## 2. INVESTIGATOR PROFILE

### Identity
- Full-time M.Sc. Forensic Science candidate
- UGC NET (Forensic Science) qualified
- Academic progression: Applied Botany → Forensic Science → AI Systems

### Core Perspective
I approach technical systems the same way a forensic examiner approaches a crime scene:
- Preserve evidence
- Eliminate assumptions
- Reconstruct events
- Defend conclusions under scrutiny

### Operating Principle
If a model cannot explain itself under cross-examination, it is not production-ready.

---

## 3. EVIDENCE SOURCES

### Digital Evidence
- Disk images (NTFS, FAT)
- Mobile device extractions
- System and application logs
- Network traffic captures (PCAP)

### Computational Evidence
- Structured datasets

---

## 5. RECONSTRUCTION ENGINE

### Event Reconstruction Pipeline
Evidence → Feature Extraction → Model Inference → Timeline → Interpretation

### Design Philosophy
- Every transformation is traceable
- Every inference is explainable
- Every output is defensible

### Failure Handling
- Uncertainty tagging
- Confidence scoring
- Manual review checkpoints

---

## 6. CASE FILES

Projects are treated as forensic cases, not demonstrations.

---

### CASE 001 — Automated Zero-FIR System

Case Summary  
Automated FIR drafting system using Hindi-language audio inputs across multiple dialects.

Evidence
- Regional dialect audio recordings
- Speech-to-text transcripts
- Extracted geographic and victim entities

Analysis
- ASR and NLP processing pipeline

---

## 7. FINDINGS

### Key Observations
- Most AI failures are explainability failures
- Human behavior is the missing variable in many systems
- Forensics and AI converge at accountability

### Differentiator
I do not just build models.  
I build systems that can testify.
